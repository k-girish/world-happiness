Abstract

The dataset is about the world happiness score. Detaily, a happiness score is based on the answer of individuals to a survey conducted by the “Gallup World Poll” where people across different countries were asked to rate their own happiness in life on a scale of 0 to 10. Also, a weighted estimate was then calculated amongst the 6 factors - economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity - determining the extent to which each of them contributed to their happiness, in each country. The above dataset contains data from 150 countries across the globe for the years 2007 - 2020 with some missing parts. This allows us to analyze, see the  relationship between these factors and model the relationship between these factors and the happiness score. Then this model, which we expect to involve as few factors as possible and achieve high accuracy, can be used to predict the happiness score in the future. Also, a wide range of clustering techniques would help us to find  various patterns both amongst different countries and for a particular country over different years.

One of the concerns about our dataset is that the number of datapoints (i.e. countries) are only 150, which is small to make any statistically significant predictions. Here’s a tentative timeline of the project - for the first week, we would try to merge the dataset coherently and look for other datasets that may help. In the second week, we will find some correlation between the factors and do the prediction task. Lastly, in the third week, we will do the clustering task and finish the paperwork.
